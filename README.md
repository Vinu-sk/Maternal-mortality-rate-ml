Maternal Mortality Rate Prediction
In this project, we aim to predict maternal health risk using various machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and TensorFlow.

XGBoost and Random Forest for Maternal Health Risk Classification
To apply XGBoost and Random Forest to maternal health risk classification, we first preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets. We then define the XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers and tune their hyperparameters using cross-validation. Some important hyperparameters to consider in XGBoost include the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, the learning rate, and the regularization parameters. For Random Forest, we consider the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and the number of features to consider for each split.

Once we have trained and tuned the XGBoost and Random Forest models, we can evaluate their performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We can also use techniques such as feature importance analysis and SHAP values to gain insights into which features are most important for predicting maternal health risk.

TensorFlow Model for Maternal Health Risk Classification
In addition to XGBoost and Random Forest, we also use a TensorFlow model to predict maternal health risk. The TensorFlow model consists of a neural network with three dense layers and a softmax activation function in the output layer. We compile the model with the Adam optimizer and the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.

We then train the TensorFlow model on the training set for 150 epochs with a batch size of 32. Once the model is trained, we use it to predict the maternal health risk on the testing set.

Model Performance
By combining the predictions of the XGBoost, Random Forest, and TensorFlow models, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 95% on the testing set. This high accuracy indicates that our models are able to effectively predict maternal health risk based on the available features.
